# SNN_Navigation
A virtual environment in which spiking neural controllers achieve autonomous navigation through evolutionary algorithms and reinforcement learning. The original environment is described  in [1], however some details, e.g. dimensions, are missing.
The experiment conducted in [1] has been redone in the virtual environment. The resulting robot trajectories are slightly different than the original ones.
